# Overview
Gradle 7.3 added support for compiling Scala 3 projects. That's great, but the default Scala project
generated by Gradle still uses Scala 2. Gradle doesn't seem to have a built-in way to specify scala
version during project generation.

That's where this project comes in. This project is just a small NodeJS script which does two things:
1. Modifies the main file **App.scala** to use an updated Scala 3 main method
2. Modifies the default **build.gradle(.kts)** file to use Scala 3 libraries and the main method as the target

**NOTE:** For library projects, only the build file is modified to use Scala 3 libraries.

# Usage
`node index.ts <project_root> <scala_version>`

Where **project_root** is the path to the project's root directory and **scala_version** is the version
string of the scala version you intend to use.

### Example:
`node index.ts ~/scala-project-root 3.1.0`
